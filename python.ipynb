    "The double equals sign, or the equivalent operator, ==, is very important in Python. It allows us to determine whether two objects are equal. We can now address the question of whether 6 and 6.0 are the same in Python.\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Since 6 and 6.0 are equivalent mathematically, it makes sense that they would be equivalent in Python, even though the types are different. Consider whether 6 should be equivalent to 42/7.

    "(20 <= age < 30) or (30 <= age < 40)\n",

    "You should get the following output:\n",
